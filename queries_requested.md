Basic set of blockchain data, in order of priority:
1. Cryptocurrency creation
   - Total supply (only one update per block)
   - How rewards are distributed (only one update per block)
   - Burned cryptocurrency
2. Cryptocurrency transactions table
   - Transaction networks in snapshots
   - Balance distributions in snapshots
3. List fungible tokens and categorise them
   - Token transaction table
   - Transaction networks in snapshots
   - Balance distribution in snapshots
4. List non-fungible tokens and categorise them
   - Token transaction table
   - Transaction networks in snapshots
   - Balance distribution in snapshots


Tables:
- Rewards/Supply
- TX cryptocurrency
- List F-tokens - it's easier to lookup for the smart contract addresses if they are all in one place
- List NF-tokens
- TX F-tokens
- TX NF-tokens


List of transactions:
- timestamp, block number
- input and output address
- amount and type of transfer (native, token, NFT)
- additional labels (mining rewards, burning)
